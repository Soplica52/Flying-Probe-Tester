Flying Probe Tester for Single-Layer PCBs
This project is a Flying Probe Tester designed to perform connectivity testing on single-layer PCBs. 
The system uses two probes to make precise measurements across various points on the PCB,
identifying short circuits, open circuits, and verifying component placements and connections.

Key Features
Two-Probe System: Includes two probes for flexible testing of connections on single-layer PCBs.
Single-Layer PCB Support: Optimized for single-layer boards, providing efficient testing of simpler PCBs.
Automated Testing Sequences: Capable of performing automated testing sequences, saving time and improving accuracy.
Easy Setup and Calibration: Straightforward configuration for fast setup and reliable testing.
How It Works
The flying probe tester positions the probes over test points on the PCB and applies electrical signals to verify connections. 
This approach allows for rapid identification of faults without the need for dedicated test fixtures, making it suitable for both prototyping and small production runs.
